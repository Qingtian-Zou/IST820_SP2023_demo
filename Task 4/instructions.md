This task is to train and evaluate the decision tree model's performances.

The general steps are listed below:
- Flatten original X data. This is needed because decision tree model can only deal with 1D data, but not multi-dimensional data like the 3D matrix originally provided.
- Dimension reduction. Traditional machine learning techniques are known to work poorly when the input space is too sparse. Therefore, dimension reduction may be needed to down-size the input space.
- Model training and evaluation.
