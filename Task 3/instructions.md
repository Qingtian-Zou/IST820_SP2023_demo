This task is to tune hyper-parameters to improve model performance. A Python script "train-classifiers.py" is provided for demonstration. Note this script is the same as the one provided in Task 2. Please take a look at how the model is built and how hyper-parameters are used, and then tune hyper-parameters as you see fit.

Some hyper-parameters are listed in line 66-68:
- hidden_tensors: The number of units in each hidden layers.
- kernel_sizes: The kernel size used in the convolutional layer.
- dropout_rates: The dropout rate in the dropout layer.
